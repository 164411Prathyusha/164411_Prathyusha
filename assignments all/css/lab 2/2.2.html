			<h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
			<p>A CSS(cascading sytle sheet)file allows you to separate your web sites
			(X)HTML content from it's style. As always you use your(X)HTML file to arrange
			the content, but all of the presentation(fonts,colors,background,borders,text,
			formating,link effects& so on...) are accomplished within a CSS. </p>
